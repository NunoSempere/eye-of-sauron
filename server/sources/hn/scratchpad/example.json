It\u2019s a new database that natively intertwines graph and vector types, without sacrificing performance. It\u2019s written in Rust and our initial focus is on supporting RAG. Here\u2019s a video runthrough: <a href=\"https://screen.studio/share/szgQu3yq\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://screen.studio/share/szgQu3yq</a>.<p>Why a hybrid? Vector databases are useful for similarity queries, while graph databases are useful for relationship queries. Each stores data in a way that\u2019s best for its main type of query (e.g. key-value stores vs. node-and-edge tables). However, many AI-driven applications need <i>both</i> similarity and relationship queries. For example, you might use vector-based semantic search to retrieve relevant legal documents, and then use graph traversal to identify relationships between cases.<p>Developers of such apps have the quandary of needing to build on top of two different databases\u2014a vector one and a graph one\u2014plus you have to link them together and sync the data. Even then, your two databases aren't designed to work together\u2014for example, there\u2019s no native way to perform joins or queries that span both systems. You\u2019ll need to handle that logic at the application level.<p>Helix started when we realized that there are ways to integrate vector and graph data that are both fast and suitable for AI applications, especially RAG-based ones. See this cool research paper: <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/html/2408.04948v1\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://arxiv.org/html/2408.04948v1</a>. After reading that and some other papers on graph and hybrid RAG, we decided to build a hybrid DB. Our aim was to make something better to use from a developer standpoint, while also making it fast as hell.<p>After a few months of working on this as a side project, our benchmarking shows that we are on par with Pinecone and Qdrant for vectors, and our graph is up to three orders of magnitude faster than Neo4j.<p>Problems where a hybrid approach works particularly well include:<p>- Indexing codebases: you can vectorize code-snippets within a function (connected by edges) based on context and then create an AST (in a graph) from function calls, imports, dependencies, etc. Agents can look up code by similarity or keyword and then traverse the AST to get only the relevant code, which reduces hallucinations and prevents the LLM from guessing object shapes or variable/function names.<p>- Molecule discovery: Model biological interactions (e.g., proteins \u2192 genes \u2192 diseases) using graph types and then embed molecule structures to find similar compounds or case studies.<p>- Enterprise knowledge management: you can represent organisational structure, projects, and people (e.g., employee \u2192 team \u2192 project) in graph form, then index internal documents, emails, or notes as vectors for semantic search and link them directly employees/teams/projects in the graph.<p>I naively assumed when learning about databases for the first time that queries would be compiled and executed like functions in traditional programming. Turns out I was wrong, but this creates unnecessary latency by sending extra data (the whole written query), compiling it at run time, and then executing it. With Helix, you write the queries in our query language (HelixQL), which is then transpiled into Rust code and built directly into the database server, where you can call a generated API endpoint.<p>Many people have a thing against \u201cyet another query language\u201d (doubtless for good reason!) but we went ahead and did it anyway, because we think it makes working with our database so much easier that it\u2019s worth a bit of a learning curve. HelixQL takes from other query languages such as Gremlin, Cypher and SQL with some extra ideas added in. It is declarative while the traversals themselves are functional. This allows complete control over the traversal flow while also having a cleaner syntax. HelixQL returns JSON to make things easy for clients. Also, it uses a schema, so the queries are type-checked.<p>We took a crude approach to building the original graph engine as a way to get an MVP out, so we are now working on improving the graph engine by making traversals massively parallel and pipelined. This means data is only ever decoded from disk when it is needed, and parts of reads are all processed in parallel.<p>If you\u2019d like to try it out in a simple RAG demo, you can follow this guide and run our Jupyter notebook: <a href=\"https://github.com/HelixDB/helix-db/tree/main/examples/rag_demo\">https://github.com/HelixDB/helix-db/tree/main/examples/rag_d...</a><p>Many thanks!
