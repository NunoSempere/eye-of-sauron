2025/05/13 19:11:44 Req url: https://joinhandshake.com/blog/our-team/effortless-ios-snapshot-testing-using-emerge-tools/
2025/05/13 19:11:47 Summary: Writing tests is essential for iOS development at Handshake, where multiple teams update the codebase frequently. The testing strategy includes unit tests, UI tests, and snapshot tests to ensure UI consistency and prevent regressions that affect user experience. Snapshot tests compare the actual UI against reference images to detect visual changes, thereby addressing shortcomings in both unit and UI tests.

The migration to Emerge Tools for snapshot testing has significantly improved the testing process. Features such as automatic generation of snapshot test cases, elimination of unnecessary code, and ease of use have streamlined workflows. Emerge's system automatically tracks reference images and integrates with existing CI processes, allowing teams to focus on development while maintaining high testing standards.
